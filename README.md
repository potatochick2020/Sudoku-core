# Sudoku
A C++ library for generating, validating, solving, checking, etc Sudoku puzzle. 

# Installation 

```
make sudoku

./sudoku 
```

# Todo

## Code

- [ ] Create Header files
  
As what it stated ...

- [ ] Reorganize code using OOP approach

This is my first CPP project, I don't think I wrote OOP code properly. 

- [ ] Optimised code for performance

The function 'SudokuSolution()' is an enhanced version of [ leetcode - Sudoku solver ]( https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/ ). My code might not be that optimised in terms of performance. 

- [ ] Rename variable

I wrote this in a rush , some variable is not named properly and are not consistent. rename it with meaningful variable name

- [ ] Testing

Testing is important. Any testing framework is fine but personally prefer bash scripting to test out the function.

- [ ] Better output format

Print it properly? Probably it will be ideal that I could see obvious changes to show the border of 3x3 box.

## No Code

- [ ] documentation 

Provide Documentation on each function on what it does. Please also provide documentation on elaboration on the algorithm especially for 'SudokuSolution()' and 'initialize()'
